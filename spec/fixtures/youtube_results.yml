  title: These Were The All-Time Surfing Moments Of The Year | Best Of 2020
  description: "Well, that was a weird ride. Though it hasn't been easy, at least
    when we fixed our gaze on the ocean — or favorite place in the world – very little
    had changed. \n\nFrom Justine Dupont, Kai Lenny, Lucas Chumbo, and Conor Maguire's
    mind-blowing antics at Nazaré, Jaws and Mullaghmore to Carissa Moore, Caroline
    Marks, Jamie O'Brien, and Kanoa Igarashi's footwork on the world's most high-performance
    waves, we packed it all in here — and then some. \n\nFor a full look at the edits
    we've sampled in the 2020 Best Of clip, check out the list below:\n\n- Life of

  title: Huge Wave Slams Unlucky Surfers - Uluwatu
  description: "This was one of the biggest days of the year a few months ago. Uluwatu's
    Outside Corner had some bombs, but the lineup looked really unpredictable. \n\nThere
    would be no major waves for extended periods, and then a big wide set could suddenly
    show up - catching out anyone that may have been chasing waves on the inside.
    With a couple more behind the first one, there was nothing to do for these three
    surfers but cop the whole set on the head.\n\nSubscribe to this channel here:

  title: Ian Walsh's How-To Guide for a Big Wave Winter | FOLLOWING Ep7
  description: "From Ian Walsh preparing his equipment for XXL waves, to giving his
    boards their first test-drives in somewhat surprising surf, this installment of
    Following is an insight into the thoroughly prepared existence of a man who leaves
    nothing to chance. \n\nAs the Northern winter rolls around again we revisit last
    year’s fly-on-the-wall edit from the crew at Inherent Bummer, who first met up
    with Ian Walsh at home in Maui, before following him across the Pacific to surf
    Mavericks in California, with good friends and fellow chargers Kai Lenny and Lucas
    “Chumbo” Chianca.  \n\nIt’s an eye-opening look at what goes on in the world of
    the modern big surfer, who live their lives at the whim of the weather and need
    to be ready to drop everything and go at the first sign of a storm front. We’ve
    all seen the dramatic images of surfing’s gladiators taming monsters in the middle
    of the ocean, but have you seen the 4am wake-ups, the endless wrestling of huge
    board bags through airports, and the shivering pre-dawn carpark rev up sessions?
    Hit play above and enter the world of the wave warrior now.  \n\nRead more about
    the wild world of big wave warrior Ian Walsh \U0001F447\U0001F3FB\nhttps://www.redbull.com/int-en/following-ian-walsh\n\nCheck
