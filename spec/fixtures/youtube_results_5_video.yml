  title: These Were The All-Time Surfing Moments Of The Year | Best Of 2020
  description: "Well, that was a weird ride. Though it hasn't been easy, at least
    when we fixed our gaze on the ocean — or favorite place in the world – very little
    had changed. \n\nFrom Justine Dupont, Kai Lenny, Lucas Chumbo, and Conor Maguire's
    mind-blowing antics at Nazaré, Jaws and Mullaghmore to Carissa Moore, Caroline
    Marks, Jamie O'Brien, and Kanoa Igarashi's footwork on the world's most high-performance
    waves, we packed it all in here — and then some. \n\nFor a full look at the edits

  title: Huge Wave Slams Unlucky Surfers - Uluwatu
  description: "This was one of the biggest days of the year a few months ago. Uluwatu's
    Outside Corner had some bombs, but the lineup looked really unpredictable. \n\nThere
    would be no major waves for extended periods, and then a big wide set could suddenly
    show up - catching out anyone that may have been chasing waves on the inside.
    With a couple more behind the first one, there was nothing to do for these three
    surfers but cop the whole set on the head.\n\nSubscribe to this channel here:

  title: INDONESIA in 4k - Surfing with Kai Lenny, Anthony Walsh, Tati West and more
    - Relaxing Ocean Sounds
  description: "Enjoy AMAZING 4k surfing and beautiful landscapes while you relax.
    Filmed by Andy Potts and Anthony Walsh in Indonesia.\n\nIndonesia is a huge country
    with thousands of islands covering a large swath of the Indian Ocean, so the weather
    tends to vary from one location to another. That being said, average temperatures
    in most areas hover around 80 F (27 C) all year, with water temps in the same
    range. The dry season (May through September) sees consistent trade winds from
    the east/southeast, while the wet season (October through April) sees more variable
    wind patterns (although it is important to note that local weather can vary drastically
    from island to island). Swells are more consistent during the dry season, but
    its possible to score waves just about any time of year.\n\nTYPES OF SURF BREAKS:
    The majority of the waves in Indonesia break over coral reefs, although there
    are some volcanic reefs and beach breaks as well. Waves range from user-friendly/high-performance
    to dredging barrels.\n\nLEVEL OF DIFFICULTY: While the waves in Indonesia range
    from beginner to expert, the majority of the best-known waves are in the intermediate+
    category, with powerful barrels and sharp, shallow reefs.\n\nSEASON AND SWELL
    INFO: The dry season runs from May through September, and enjoys consistent E/SE
    trade winds and frequent south swells. The wet season, which extends from October
    through April, sees more light/variable wind conditions, and less frequent south
    swells (although the waves are still relatively consistent).\n\nHOLLOW TREES (HTs)
    • The wave that put the Mentawais on the map, and one of the best right-hand barrels
    in a country best known for lefts. HTs (also known as Lance’s Right, after the
    feral Aussie surfer who discovered it) is a heavy, perfect barrel from head high
    to double overhead, breaking over shallow reef that gets even shallower on the
    inside Surgeon’s Table section. Often crowded due to its popularity with luxury
    boat tours and a nearby land camp, HTs needs a large SW swell and NE to E wind
    to really turn on. One of the most photographed and filmed waves in the world
    over the past two decades, HTs has starred in films such as September Sessions
    and …Lost at Sea.\n\nDESERT POINT • When people think of surfing in Lombok, they
    think of one wave—Desert Point. Arguably one of the best waves in the world, Desert
    Point is a rare, heavy, shallow, left-hand barrel that grows the farther down
    the line it grinds. Tube rides in excess of 15 seconds have been logged here,
    but the wave is notoriously crowded, and only breaks on a huge SW swell at low
    tide (it actually goes flat sometimes at high tide, despite a pumping swell!).\n\nULUWATU
    on the Bukit Peninsula is the original Indonesian dream wave—a long, rippable
    left-hand wall breaking in front of limestone cliffs that was immortalized in
    the seminal film Morning of the Earth. While not Indonesia’s heaviest or hollowest
    wave, Uluwatu does have barreling sections, and the Outside Corner section can
    turn into one of the country’s only legitimate big wave spots during huge swells.
    Uluwatu can be quite crowded, but typically picks up more swell than any other
    spot on Bali. Get the lowdown on surfing Uluwatu.\n\nPADANG PADANG is also on
    the Bukit, and is arguably Bali’s best barrel. Only working on large SW swells
    with mid tides, Padang Padang is a challenging, dangerous, expert-only left-hand
    barrel that many refer to as the “Balinese Pipeline.”\n\n✅ Support my passion

  title: Ian Walsh's How-To Guide for a Big Wave Winter | FOLLOWING Ep7
  description: "From Ian Walsh preparing his equipment for XXL waves, to giving his
    boards their first test-drives in somewhat surprising surf, this installment of
    Following is an insight into the thoroughly prepared existence of a man who leaves
    nothing to chance. \n\nAs the Northern winter rolls around again we revisit last
    year’s fly-on-the-wall edit from the crew at Inherent Bummer, who first met up
    with Ian Walsh at home in Maui, before following him across the Pacific to surf
    Mavericks in California, with good friends and fellow chargers Kai Lenny and Lucas
    “Chumbo” Chianca.  \n\nIt’s an eye-opening look at what goes on in the world of
    the modern big surfer, who live their lives at the whim of the weather and need
    to be ready to drop everything and go at the first sign of a storm front. We’ve
    all seen the dramatic images of surfing’s gladiators taming monsters in the middle
    of the ocean, but have you seen the 4am wake-ups, the endless wrestling of huge
    board bags through airports, and the shivering pre-dawn carpark rev up sessions?
    Hit play above and enter the world of the wave warrior now.  \n\nRead more about
